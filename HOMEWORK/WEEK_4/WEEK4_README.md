Write a program with excellent comments using a programming language of your choice
to perform AND provide answers to the following tasks:

1. Load the patient data from “ML_HW_Data_Patients.csv” file (same data file in
the last assignment).

2. Use the following 7 variables Age, Gender, Height, Weight, Smoker, Location,
SelfAssessedHealthStatus to build a linear regression model to predict the
systolic blood pressure.

3. Use **lasso regression** with **10-fold cross-validation** to identify useful
predictors.

4. Which top **TWO** remaining predictors (with non-zero theta values) are you
going to select after the lasso analysis?

5. What is the lambda (l) value you choose in order to select the top two predictors
you identified in the last question?

6. What are the q values for the two selected predictors at the lambda (l) value you
identified in the last question?

7. This question can be more difficult in Python; hence optional if you use
Python. Plot a lasso plot with OR without cross-validation. Please have readable
tick labels on the X and Y axes in your plot for easy visualization and verification.
